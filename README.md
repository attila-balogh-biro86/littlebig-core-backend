# Spring Modulith reference implementation

[![Quality gate](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/quality_gate?project=attila-balogh-biro86_littlebig-core-backend)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=attila-balogh-biro86_littlebig-core-backend)

In this project, I'm demonstrating how to implement the modulith app using Spring support. Here are the [docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith) about the project. 


You need to have JDK21 and Maven. Also run Docker on your machine to enable Zipkin container.
Then just run the app with the following command:
```shell
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
